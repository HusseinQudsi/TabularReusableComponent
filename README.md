# tabular-reusable-component

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9 using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that demonstrates a tabular reusable component.

## Application link
Application playground: [TabularReusableComponent](https://husseinqudsi.github.io/TabularReusableComponent/).

## Getting started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HusseinQudsi/TabularReusableComponent
cd tabular-reusable-component
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run lint` - runs `tslint` on the project files.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
